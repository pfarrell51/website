<h2> Pat Farrell's family genealogy.</h2>

<h2>Family Tree</h2>
<a href=tree>Reunion generated family tree</a>
<p><p>

This information is freely available to all family, with a pretty broad definition of family,
but I do retain the copyright to the data and collection. Please, do not upload this data to any
commercial genealogy website, such as Ancestry.com. I dislike that these commercial companies accept in 
genealogy research and then charge others for access.
<p><p>
The tree is generated using the <a href="http://www.leisterpro.com/">Reunion 11 for Macintosh</a> software.
I've tried a bunch of different programs for storing genealogy data, and I like Reunion 11 far more than any other.
It runs only on Apple OS-X (Macintosh) and Apple IOS (iPhone, iPad, etc.) computers. I keep my MacBook Pro laptop
solely to run Reunion.
