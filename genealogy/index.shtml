<h2> Pat Farrell's family genealogy.</h2>
<p>
Pat's parents were from Omaha Nebraska. Pat's dad was 
<a href="/genealogy/tree/ps01/ps01_004.html">Andrew H Farrell</a>,
 born 1910 in Omaha NE. 
His mom was <a href="/genealogy/tree/ps01/ps01_005.html">Clare Margaret (Scogin) Farrell</a>,
 born in 1914 in Omaha. NE.

<p>
<h2>Family Tree</h2>
<a href=tree/wc01/wc01_001.html>Farrell-Scogin of Omaha Nebraska</a> generated by Reunion 13.
<p><p>

This information is freely available to all family, with a pretty broad 
definition of family, but I do retain the copyright to the data and collection. Please, do not upload this data to any commercial genealogy website, such as Ancestry.com. I dislike that these commercial companies accept in 
genealogy research and then charge others for access.
<p><p>
The tree is generated using the 
<a href="http://www.leisterpro.com/">Reunion 13 for Macintosh</a> software.
I've tried a bunch of different programs for storing genealogy data, and I like Reunion 13 far more than any other.
It runs only on Apple OS-X (Macintosh) and Apple IOS (iPhone, iPad, etc.) computers. I keep my MacBook Pro laptop
solely to run Reunion.
<p>
While by definition, a genealogy tree is all about the "begats" as in "Peter begat Daniel who begat Daniel who begat Harry". Straight out of the Old Testament. But that is not my interest. Its just what we have to do to get to
what I consider the interesting parts: the stories and characters. 
Who in the tree is a card shark, cattle rustler,
claim jumper, outlaw or even politician. That is what I want to know and record.

<h2>Photos and sources for the Family Tree</h2>
I have collected a fair number of photos and historical documents recording my family tree.
Many of the photos and documents are included in the family tree. 
<a href=gphotos/index.html> This is the whole collection, not in any particular order, yet.</a>


<h2>Where are we from.</h2>
We are all immigrants. As far as I can tell, I have no acestors who were Native Americans.
The family tree goes back to the usual mostly white Europeans who came over
in the 1700s and 1800s.
