<h2> Pat Farrell's family genealogy.</h2>
<p>
Pat's parents were from Omaha Nebraska. Pat's dad was 
<a href="/genealogy/tree/ps01/ps01_004.htm">Andrew H Farrell</a>,
 born 1910 in Omaha NE. 
His mom was <a href="/genealogy/tree/ps01/ps01_005.htm">Clare Margaret (Scogin) Farrell</a>,
 born in 1914 in Omaha. NE.

<p>
<h2>Family Tree</h2>
<a href=tree>Farrell-Scogin of Omaha Nebraska</a> generated by Reunion 11.

This information is freely available to all family, with a pretty broad definition of family,
but I do retain the copyright to the data and collection. Please, do not upload this data to any
commercial genealogy website, such as Ancestry.com. I dislike that these commercial companies accept in 
genealogy research and then charge others for access.
<p><p>
The tree is generated using the <a href="http://www.leisterpro.com/">Reunion 11 for Macintosh</a> software.
I've tried a bunch of different programs for storing genealogy data, and I like Reunion 11 far more than any other.
It runs only on Apple OS-X (Macintosh) and Apple IOS (iPhone, iPad, etc.) computers. I keep my MacBook Pro laptop
solely to run Reunion.

<hr>
We are all immigrants. As far as I can tell, I have no acestors who were Native Americans.
The family tree goes back to the usual mostly white Europeans who came over
in the 1700s and 1800s.
