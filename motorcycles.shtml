      <p>I'm a motorcycle nut. I only have three now. I started riding when I was 18, way back in 1969.

 <p>Trail/enduro. My first motorcycle was a Hodaka Ace 90, I bought it with the earnings of my work in the summer of 1969.
It was a "dirt bike" altho it nominally was street legal.
I think I even got real Virginia plate and registration for it.

My friend Lloyd introduced me to street bikes, my early bikes were mostly dirt bikes. 
Once I rode Lloyd's Yamaha R5, I was hooked.
I had to have my own Yamaha 350, so I bought a Yamaha RD350.
<p>
<p>
In a few years, I got into road racing, and did that up through the 1987 season.

     <div class="col-sm-4">I got out of motorcycles, did not ride one again for about 30 years.
Then I slowly got back into it. Last Summer, I bought a new enduro bike, a KTM 300 XC-W.
<p>
I've collected some <a href=gpstrails>GPS/GPX tracks of trails.</a> No guarentees, but I've had fun on them.

      <h5><span class="label label-success">Observed Trials</span></h5><br>
      <p>Trials (or more properly "Observed Trials") is a motorcycle sport that is unlike anything I've done before.
Its about balance and timing, not about speed.
I recently bought a used trials bike, so I can improve my balance and bike control.<br>

I attended Ryan Young's trials school in Shepherdstown WV at the end of September 2017.
He is a great guy, check out his <a href="http://rypusa.com/">Ryan Young Products</a> website.
