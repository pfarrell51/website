      <p>I'm a motorcycle nut. I only have two now. I started riding when I was 18, way back in 1969. I've sold two bikes in the past couple of months, and bought one new one.

      <p>Trials (or more properly "Observed Trials") is a motorcycle sport that is unlike anything I've done before.
Its about balance and timing, not about speed.
In October 2017, I bought a used trials bike, so I can improve my balance and bike control.<br>

I swapped up to a new trials bike, as lots of knowledgeable folks told me that a smaller bike
would be easier to learn on. I really need to learn, I am terrible at this style of riding.
