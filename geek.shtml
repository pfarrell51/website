Pat is a retired software engineer. I got into programming on punched cards.
I have used a ton of languages and operating systems. I even
know a bit about networking and proper setup of TCP/IP hosts.
<p>
That means I'm a geek or nerd.

I keep public repositories on <a href="https://github.com/>github.com</a>
For example, the source code to this website is on github as

I am playing with the 'go' language.
It seems to be designed to address the types of problems that I like to work in.
I have neve really been an application developer, although I have done that. I generally prefer
to work at the intersection of the application, the operating sytem, hardware, network and other
technical stuff.

cockroach is an interesting database, it started as not yet another SQL relational thing. But
I will have to look at it more closely to see what it really is, since it uses
SQL for as a query language. That might not be bad.
Relational databases are so overrated.
