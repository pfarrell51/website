<h2>Pat Farrell's collection of useful and not so useful information</h2>
I'm a retired software engineer. 
This is my personal website. It reflects my interests currently and over some portion of my history.

  <p>
    
      <h2>I Love Motorcycles and my grandkids</h2>
Since I am retired, I get to do what I want. These days, what I want is mostly focused on my family and motorcycles.
Family including my wife, daughter, her husband, and the two world's best grand-daughters.
I have a separate section on <a href=/motorcycles>Motorcycles</a>, and don't post photos of my family 
because the Internet is too full of weirdos.
   

      
Additional hobbies include:
<ul>
<li>Photography
<li>small scale systems (Adruino and Raspberry PI, etc.)
<li>music
<li>History
<li>politics
<li>Modern programming languages (go, scala, etc.)
<li><a href=tech>Random technical stuff</a>
<li>Alternative block chain technologies such as
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nQE_HAGlmM">Algorand: A Better Distributed Ledger," with Silvio Micali"</a>

</ul>
